<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

![image1][image1]

### Project Description

Based on personal experience with interacting with university administration systems, they were always to complicated to comprehend, in terms of the information architecture and the user flow. Therefore the importance of online learning and students who want to register must not be overlooked. 

The importance of the role of administration according to an article by Pankaj Mishra, states that it is essentially the “backbone of an organization” (2014). They provide “motivation to the work force and make them realize the goals of the organization” (2014). The system needs to be as efficient and effective, but also functional in a manner that is super easy to understand.

The final name I chose for my project is Enum IntegrateX. Enum is short for enumarated, which is a data type that consists of predefined values. The enum in the name is for all the data that is a part of the university system. The IntegrateX is for how easy the tool is to use alongside an existing system. The system will be focused on providing the best user experience, easy for the administrators to manage all the data. It will be a tool added to an existing software to use.

Enum IntegrateX is a tool that aids the management of university administration. Making the workforce of the admins more efficient and effective.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the backend of the application.

### Implementation

#### Highlights

* Understanding and grasping `TornadoFx` as a framework.
* Using `TornadoFx` to create the layouts and user interface design of my application.
* Utilising the `MVC arhcitecture` for my project's structure and functionality.
* The `UI design` of my application, alongside the user experience, giving it the best I could.
* The `customised details design` of all the students, staff, and subjects.
* Integrating `Kotlin` into the project for the main logic and functionality.

#### Challenges

* Integration of the `database` was a very big challenge with the structure my project took.
* The `search functionality` with the customised list items I used in my project.
* Understanding how all the `data links` to each other with the students, staff, and subjects.

#### Future Changes

* `Finish` integrating the `database`. Add full functional login system.
* Having the `search functionality` working and add animations.
* The ability to `add universities` to the system.
