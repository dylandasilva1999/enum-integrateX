<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

<!--![image1][image1]-->

### Project Description

Based on personal experience with interacting with university administration systems, they were always to complicated to comprehend, in terms of the information architecture and the user flow. Therefore the importance of online learning and students who want to register must not be overlooked. 

The importance of the role of administration according to an article by Pankaj Mishra, states that it is essentially the “backbone of an organization” (2014). They provide “motivation to the work force and make them realize the goals of the organization” (2014). The system needs to be as efficient and effective, but also functional in a manner that is super easy to understand.

Enum IntegrateX is a tool that to aid the management of university administration. Making the work force of the admins more efficient and effective.
